<!-- 

It's a good idea to have the images in a div together for your own reference if you're making the images link to a gallery
<div class='img-set'>
</div> 

1a. data-lightbox='pong' data-title='<a href="https://tor020.github.io/Pong/">Pong</a>'

1b. data-lightbox = 'pong'  

1c. data-lightbox is the name of the image group. You can group multiple images this way.

2a. data-title='<a href="https://tor020.github.io/Pong/">Pong</a>'

2b. data-title allows you to setup the title to function as a hyperlink so that the image name that appears can be clicked as a hyperlink

the href is just the image that the lightbox modal opens

nest the image thumbnails inside the anchor tags 

ex: 

<a data-lightbox='NAME GROUPING' data-title='<a href="">URL IN LIGHTBOX DESCRIPTION</a>' href="IMAGE TO OPEN">
  <img class="THUMNAIL" src="THUMBNAIL LOCATION" alt = "">
</a>
